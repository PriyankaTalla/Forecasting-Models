Mathematical Topics:
Statistics: Mean, rolling averages.
Example: Forecasting monthly sales based on previous months.

2. Exponential Smoothing
Concepts: Weighted averages, level smoothing.
Mathematical Topics:
Statistics: Exponential decay, weighted sums.
Example: Forecasting quarterly GDP based on previous observations.

3. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
Concepts: Time series decomposition, stationarity.
Mathematical Topics:
Statistics: Autocorrelation, differencing.
Linear Algebra: Matrix operations (for linear equations).
Example: Forecasting daily stock prices based on historical data.

4. Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)
Concepts: Incorporates seasonal components into ARIMA.
Mathematical Topics:
Statistics: Seasonal differencing, seasonal autoregression, seasonal moving average.
Example: Forecasting quarterly sales with seasonal trends using SARIMA.
